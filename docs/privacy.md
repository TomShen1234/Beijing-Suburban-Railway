# Privacy Policy #

The creator of this app, Weiran Du, or stringconstant on GitHub, genuinely advocates the privacy for users in this digital age. Therefore, neither stringconstant nor Beijing Suburban Railway collects any personal data from the app's users. 

The owner (Wenhua Du, my legal guardian) of the developer account, under which I publish this app as a minor, also couldn't have any of users' personal information. Here is a list below about how the app would handle sensitive data by now:

* Beijing Suburban Railway does not require your location to function*
* Beijing Suburban Railway does not require network connection to function. This makes data transmission between your phone and 
our potential servers technically impossibe*
* Beijing Suburban Railway does not require your camera capabilities to function*
* Beijing Suburban Railway does not require your microphone capabilities to function*

(* Plus, it does not even request these capabilities)



Also, I will regularly check whether suspicious code exists in this project. With the peace of mind, feel free to explore Beijing Suburban Railway (pun intended).
